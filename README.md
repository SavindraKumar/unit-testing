## Unit testing framework
CppUTest unit test framework is used for this training.

For more information about CppUTest visit below link:
[CppUTest](https://cpputest.github.io/)

## Setting up CppUTest
1. Clone CppUTest repository from below github link: https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest.git
2. Go to the directory in Cygwin terminal where the CppUTest source code has been cloned, then execute the following commands in sequence:

## Production code environment
Production code is written for STM32 MCU and it can be build using STM32Cube ID. 

**Note**: It is not mandatory to have STM32 Cube ID because production code is unit tested on host machine using CppUTest framework.
